# Random gene set samples of PMID26623667

In this directory, random gene sets of PMID26623667 are created and cached. The data are used to determine how well a random gene set models drift. These random gene set samples provide a background reference against which gene sets can be compared. For example, it allows one to determine whether a gene set performs better than a gene set generated randomly.

Random gene sets are generated by `make_genesets.ipynb`, and stored as JSON files in the `genesets/` folder. The actual files are not included due to storage limitations, but are guaranteed to be the same each time when generated by `make_genesets.ipynb`.

## Model Fitting

After the gene sets have been created, linear and log-linear models of drift for each gene set are created by `calc_models.py`, and stored as tsv files in the `models/` directory.

Models are not stored in the repository due to space constraints, but are stable across different runs.
